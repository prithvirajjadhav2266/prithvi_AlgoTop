# 🎟️ AlgoSphere - Decentralized Campus Event Ticketing on Algorand

> **Hackathon Submission | Round 1**
> Built using AlgoKit, PyTEAL, and React - by students, for students.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Managing campus events today is often fragmented and opaque:

* Clubs collect payments manually or through external platforms.
* Tickets can be duplicated or forged.
* No verifiable record of attendance.
* Event organization lacks transparency and trust.

These issues make event management inefficient and erode student trust.

## 🌟 Our Solution - AlgoSphere

AlgoSphere is a fully decentralized event ticketing platform built on the Algorand blockchain. It empowers university clubs to:

* ✅ Register officially on-chain.
* 🧾 Create tamper-proof events.
* 🎫 Mint tickets as Algorand Standard Assets (ASAs / NFTs).
* 💰 Sell tickets to students using ALGO.
* 🎟️ Let students store tickets in their wallets.
* 🛂 Verify ticket ownership at entry.

### 💡 Key Innovations

* Built fully on-chain using **PyTEAL** smart contracts
* **Tickets are ASAs (NFTs)** - no duplication, no forgery
* **Wallet-based identity** - no signup, just connect wallet
* **Transparent event ledger** for admins and clubs

## 🏛️ Example Use Case: MLSC Club Hackathon

The **MLSC club** at our university is organizing "Hexpiration 26" - a 24-hour blockchain hackathon.

1. They register on AlgoSphere.
2. They create the event: "Hexpiration 26", 3 ALGO per ticket.
3. 50 NFT tickets are minted and listed for sale.
4. Students connect their wallet and buy a ticket with ALGO.
5. At check-in, students scan a QR code to verify ticket ownership.

> 🎉 No middlemen. No forged entries. Transparent on-chain record.

## 🧠 Tokenomics & Design

| Action         | Cost (User) | ALGO Flow            |
| -------------- | ----------- | -------------------- |
| Club registers | ~0 ALGO     | Fee paid to deployer |
| Create event   | ~0 ALGO     | Ticket ASA minted    |
| Buy ticket     | 0.001 ALGO* | Payment to club      |
| Verify ticket  | 0 ALGO      | Read-only on-chain   |

> *We use micro-ALGO transfers for testing/demo purposes. Ticket prices are reduced for demo flow.*
